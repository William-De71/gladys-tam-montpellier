# The only writable location allowed at runtime. Docker creates a new volume
# with the owner of the image's /data, so it must belong to `node`, and before
# VOLUME: changes made to /data after it are discarded. Without this, /data is
# root-owned and the integration cannot write to it.
# The daily reading of the timetable inflates a 25 MB file: a bounded heap
# makes the collector work early and keeps the container well under 256 MB.
