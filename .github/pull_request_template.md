<!--
The TITLE of this pull request becomes the squash commit, then the line users
read in CHANGELOG.md and in the GitHub Release. Write it in English, as a
Conventional Commit describing the change for the user:

  feat(widgets): show the public IPv6 address in the internet widget
  fix(presence): keep a device present while its DHCP lease is renewed
  perf: read the DHCP leases only when the network devices are offered
  docs: list the privileges of the API user

feat -> minor version, fix / perf -> patch, `!` or a "BREAKING CHANGE:" footer
-> breaking (a minor while the version is below 1.0.0). docs, chore, ci, test,
style, refactor and build alone publish no release. Never edit CHANGELOG.md.
